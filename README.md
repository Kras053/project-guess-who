# Project Name

The assignment was to create a digital Guess-who game. 

## The problem

I struggled with the filtering of characters and the alerts, which was solved after watching the Technigo Live sessions and asking my team for help. Also I did not manage to get the restart function to work at the end of the game, so if I had more time I would fix this.
